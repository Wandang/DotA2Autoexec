This project is my first public project.
Its shortform will be D2A

It's goal is to simplify scripting for normal users via patterns.

For example: D2A -add puck-orb q will add the necessary code to bind
Ethereal Jaunt to the same button as Illusory Orb.

This patterns can be added to the program by sending it to a developer who
checks it first. I will try to develop the most common (or requested) myself.

If the backend works i will try to develop a frontend GUI to make it even
easier.

Since i mainly program in java this project will be a pure javadevelopment.
